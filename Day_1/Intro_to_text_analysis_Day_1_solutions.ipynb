People who are most confident about their ability to discern between fact and fiction are also the most likely to fall victim to misinformation, a US study suggests. Although Americans believe the confusion caused by false news is all-pervasive, relatively few indicate having seen or shared it, something the researchers suggested shows that many may not only have a hard time identifying false news but are not aware of their own deficiencies at doing so. Nine out of 10 participants surveyed indicated they were above average in their ability to discern false and legitimate news headlines. About a fifth of respondents rated themselves 50 or more percentiles higher than their score warranted, the analysis of a nationally representative study of data collected during and after the 2018 US midterm elections found. In the survey, 8,285 Americans were asked to evaluate the accuracy of a series of Facebook headlines, and then rate their own abilities in discerning false news content relative to others. When researchers looked at data measuring respondents’ online behaviour, those with inflated perceptions of their abilities more frequently visited websites linked to the spread of false or misleading news. The overconfident participants were also less able to distinguish between true and false claims about current events and reported higher willingness to share false content, especially when it aligned with their political predispositions, the authors found. “No matter what domain, people on average are overconfident … but over 70% of people displaying overconfidence is just such a huge number,” said the lead author, Ben Lyons, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah. Although the study does not prove that overconfidence directly causes engagement with false news, the mismatch between a person’s perceived ability to spot misinformation and their actual competence could play a crucial role in the spread of false information, the authors wrote in the studypublished in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. It also suggests that those who are humble – people who tend to engage in self-monitoring, reflective behaviours and put more thought into the sites they visit and content they share – are likely to be less susceptible to misinformation, said Lyons. Factors such as gender also played a key role in the likelihood of overconfidence and, in turn, vulnerability to false news, suggested Lyons. “Male respondents [in the study] displayed more overconfidence – and this is a consistent finding in overconfidence literature – men are always more confident than women, which is always not so surprising.” He added: “Overconfidence is truly universal. I would be shocked if we didn’t find this in every country we looked at … although we might not see this extreme level of overconfidence, just based on cultural differences.”'\n","\n","article\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PzYThMP9P9hA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define a wordcloud \n","wordcloud = WordCloud(background_color = 'white',\n","                      width = 2000, # width of canvas\n","                      height = 1000, # height of canvas\n","                      stopwords = STOPWORDS, # the built-in STOPWORDS list is used\n","                      collocations = False, # whether to include collocations (bigrams) of two words\n","                      normalize_plurals = True, # e.g. 'day' and 'days' will be counted as one\n","                      random_state = 1, # seed to get exactly same wordcloud every time you rerun script\n","                      colormap = 'seismic') # set the colormap\n","\n","# Generate a wordcloud on a string object\n","wordcloud.generate(article)\n","\n","plt.figure(figsize = (15, 10)) # set figure size\n","plt.axis(\"off\") # turn off axes details\n","\n","# Display image\n","plt.imshow(wordcloud)\n","\n","# Get rid of the object description above the wordcloud\n","plt.show()\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rsLaGO7-XiGM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Mode detailed information about the `WordCloud` command is available [here](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/index.html)."],"metadata":{"id":"9Pnc4HksqqPP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Take a look at the list of WordCloud stopwords i.e. those that are excluded from the analysis\n","STOPWORDS\n","\n","# If you want to add some specific words to the list of stopwords, you can use the .update() method:\n","# STOPWORDS.update(['word1', 'word2'])\n"],"metadata":{"id":"21vDhE8bw0nc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HZzDraYdy862"},"source":["## **Exercise 2**\n","\n","Now you can try to create a wordcloud yourself!\n","\n","Let's use [this](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/climate-change-is-intensifying-earths-water-cycle-at-twice-the-predicted-rate-research-shows) The Guardian article entitled *Climate change is intensifying Earth’s water cycle at twice the predicted rate, research shows*.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Newspaper article (no preprocessing or text cleaning has been done)\n","\n","article_2 = 'Rising global temperatures have shifted at least twice the amount of freshwater from warm regions towards the Earth’s poles than previously thought as the water cycle intensifies, according to new analysis. Climate change has intensified the global water cycle by up to 7.4% – compared with previous modelling estimates of 2% to 4%, research published in the journal Nature suggests. The water cycle describes the movement of water on Earth – it evaporates, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain or snow and falls again to the surface. “When we learn about the water cycle, traditionally we think of it as some unchanging process which is constantly filling and refilling our dams, our lakes, and our water sources,” the study’s lead author, Dr Taimoor Sohail of the University of New South Wales, said. But scientists have long known that rising global temperatures are intensifying the global water cycle, with dry subtropical regions likely to get drier as freshwater moves towards wet regions. Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report concluded that climate change will cause long-term changes to the water cycle, resulting in stronger and more frequent droughts and extreme rainfall events. Sohail said the volume of extra freshwater that had already been pushed to the poles as a result of an intensifying water cycle was far greater than previous climate models suggest. “Those dire predictions that were laid out in the IPCC will potentially be even more intense,” he said. The scientists estimate the volume of extra freshwater that shifted from warmer regions between 1970 and 2014 is between 46,000 and 77,000 cubic kms. “We’re seeing higher water cycle intensification than we were expecting, and that means we need to move even more quickly towards a path of net zero emissions.” The team used ocean salinity as a proxy for rainfall in their research. “The ocean is actually more salty in some places and less salty in other places,” Sohail said. “Where rain falls on the ocean, it tends to dilute the water so it becomes less saline … Where there is net evaporation, you end up getting salt left behind.” The researchers had to account for the mixing of water due to ocean currents. “We developed a new method that basically tracks … how the ocean is moving around with reference to this freshening or salinification,” Sohail said. “It’s kind of like a rain gauge that’s in constant motion.” Dr Richard Matear, a chief research scientist in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, who was not involved in the research, said the study suggested existing climate modelling has underestimated the potential impacts of climate change on the water cycle. “There’s been a dramatic uplift in our ability to monitor the ocean,” he said. “Observational datasets [like those used in the study] are really ripe for revisiting how global warming is changing the climate system, and the implications it might have on important things like the hydrological cycle.”'\n","\n","article_2\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Bs6_lj6P0rfG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a wordcloud here:\n","\n","# Define a wordcloud \n","wordcloud = WordCloud(background_color = 'white',\n","                      width = 2000, # width of canvas\n","                      height = 1000, # height of canvas\n","                      stopwords = STOPWORDS, # the built-in STOPWORDS list is used\n","                      collocations = False, # whether to include collocations (bigrams) of two words\n","                      normalize_plurals = True, # e.g. 'day' and 'days' will be counted as one\n","                      random_state = 1, # seed to get exactly same wordcloud every time you rerun script\n","                      colormap = 'seismic') # set the colormap\n","\n","# Generate a wordcloud on a string object\n","wordcloud.generate(article_2)\n","\n","plt.figure(figsize = (15, 10)) # set figure size\n","plt.axis(\"off\") # turn off axes details\n","\n","# Display image\n","plt.imshow(wordcloud)\n","\n","# Get rid of the object description above the wordcloud\n","plt.show()\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LBUeCiuQ0sPl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M8g6p6TF8C_A"},"source":["# **That's the end of Day 1!**"]}]}
